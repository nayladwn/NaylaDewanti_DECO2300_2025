# Immersive Interior Design XR – User Testing Plan (Interactive Prototype 3)

## Overview

This prototype is an updated version of my previous XR bedroom design project. Instead of just one room, users can now explore a full apartment and interact with furniture around the space.
The big new feature is the ability to repaint walls — users can use a virtual brush to change wall colors and materials while still being able to move and rotate furniture.
The goal is to test how natural and easy these interactions feel inside XR, and whether users find the experience fun and intuitive.


## Testing Objectives

The main things I want to find out are:

1. How easily can users grab, move, and rotate furniture in a larger environment?
2. Do users understand how to repaint walls using the brush tool without needing too much explanation?
3. Does the overall experience feel smooth, immersive, and satisfying?


## Assumptions

* Moving and painting will feel straightforward to most users.
* People will treat the paint roller like a real one — they’ll expect the wall color to change right away when they touch it.
* The furniture controls from the last version will still feel **natural and intuitive** in a bigger apartment space.


## Prototype Description

The XR prototype includes:

* A multi-room apartment (living room, bedroom, kitchen area).
* Furniture that can be grabbed, moved, and rotated using controllers.
* A paint roller tool that lets users:

  * Choose wall colors or materials.
  * Apply them by touching or pointing at walls.
* Optional reset button so they can try again or test multiple times.

### Key Interactions

* Move and rotate furniture.
* Paint walls with new colors or materials.
* Walk around the apartment.


## Testing Methodology

### Method

The testing will use a think-aloud protocol, but adapted for VR.
Participants will wear the headset (Meta Quest 2) and complete a few short tasks. I’ll give minimal instruction to see how intuitive everything feels.

They’ll be encouraged to talk about what they’re thinking while they interact. If they go quiet, I’ll remind them to describe what’s going on in their head.

### Tasks

1. Move furniture: Rearrange some furniture around the apartment.
2. Paint walls: Use the paint roller tool to change the color or material of a few walls.
3. Combine both: Move some furniture and repaint the nearby wall however they like — basically redesign part of the room.

## Data Collection

I’ll collect both **observation data** and user feedback.

# Data collected:

* Screen + audio recording of the session.
* Observation notes:

  * What gestures users try (grabbing, rotating, painting).
  * Where they get stuck or confused.
  * How they move around the space.
* Task performance:

  * Time taken for each task.
  * Mistakes or failed paint attempts.
  * Number of times they needed help.
* Post-test questionnaire:

  * Ease of use (1–5).
  * How intuitive the painting felt (1–5).
  * Overall satisfaction (1–5).
  * How immersive it felt (1–5).
* Short interview:

  * What felt the most natural?
  * Was painting easy or confusing?
  * Did the system behave how you expected?
  * Any ideas to improve it?


## Testing Setup

* Equipment: Meta Quest 2 headset running the Unity XR prototype.
* Location: UQ Studio Classroom
* Facilitator tools: Laptop for recording and iPad for note-taking.
* Prototype features:

  * Apartment layout.
  * Interactive furniture and walls.
  * Paint roller tool for color/material changes.


## Testing Procedure

| Step                               | Time    | What happens                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Intro                           | 1 min   | Explain that they’ll be exploring an apartment in VR and can move furniture + paint walls. |
| 2. Get comfortable                 | 1 min   | Let them adjust to the headset and basic controls.                                         |
| 3. Task 1: Move furniture          | 3–4 min | Ask them to rearrange at least two items in the apartment.                                 |
| 4. Task 2: Paint walls             | 3–4 min | Ask them to change the color or material of one or more walls.                             |
| 5. Task 3: Combine                 | 2–3 min | Encourage them to move and paint together however they like.                               |
| 6. Post-test questions + interview | 3–5 min | Ask for feedback and thoughts.                                                             |
| 7. Debrief                         | 30 sec  | Thank them and explain the purpose again.                                                  |
